# Serve #

There are two flavors of `serve` that you can use:
- with prompt
- without prmpt

## With Prompt ##

To use the command, just do:
	boiler serve

Then it will ask you for a port number. You can choose a value from 8000 to 9000. If you choose 8989
for example, then you can see the server at `http://localhost:8989`

After that, will ask you for the folder that you want to serve. You can either drag and drop the
folder to the terminal and hit enter, or you can put in the path relative to the current path that
you are in. So if you are running the command for a folder that has another folder with the name
`public`, you can just put in `./public`. You can specify relative paths just like that:
`../public`, `./public.main` and so on.

## Wihtout the Prompt ##

The command format is:
	boiler s path -p portnumber

where:
	s: is the serve command without prompt
	path: path to the folder that you want to serve.
	-p: specifies that port number

Example:
	boiler s ./public -p 5000

Starts the serve at `./public` at port 5000.
